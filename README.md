<h4>Key Points:</h4>

- The central concept is the draggable card from one div to another div, which was completed without the use of any react draggable tools and focusing on typescript with local storage.
- A card will also be locked, deleted, and edited.
- Card content is also able to be copied.
- A locked card will not be able to delete, edit, and copy.
